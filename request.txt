1. Exchange Selection - I dont want to limit myself here, just because I'm already using kraken. I can make accounts anywhere, and send money anywhere. I am located in the US, if that makes a difference, but I DO have a VPN that will allow me to act as if im anywhere in the world.
2. I would like a Web UI. I want it to have all the information about the trades being made, future predictions, the learning its doing, potential pump and dumps, crypto wallet balances, gains/losses. It should have charts and tables, and they should all be sortable and filterable by the fields/options/etc (like what the other Exchanges let you do). I would like the Web UI to be viewable in the browser, and then maybe also have an android app linked to the web ui, if that makes sense?
And I want the UI to look sleek, and modern, almost even futuristic, but not too flashy. I want it to make stylish but subtle use of gradients for shading and highlighting.
3. I like the idea of a hybrid approach. I think hosting the webapp on a free cloud server, so its accessable from anywhere, anytime, would be nice. I'm hoping theres some sort of free cloud server though. If not, it needs to be very cheap, or atleast have a free trial. I think that side of things could do all of the frontend, and possibly initiate the trades, while it could use my desktop with my 4080, to do all of the learning, and ai model training. Just like you said, ML on desktop, lightweight trading bot in cloud.
4. Paper trading is a good idea.
